# Motivation
After I did the [IDSProject](https://github.com/DjallenDias/IDSProject), I got motivated to analyze more about Brazil, comparing it with others countries.

I want to see some data about Brazil and compare this with countries that are more and less developed than Brazil.

And, I will look for things like:
- How much a more/less developed country than Brazil increased the GDP/GPD per capita after X time?
- How much did a country as developed as Brazil increased the GDP/GPD per capita after X time?

### Files
On `datacleasing.ipynb` I will put the code that I used to clean some data, and comments to describe why i made some decisions.

On `notebook.ipynb` I will do everything necessary to get insights from the data.

On `insights.ipynb` I will put the insights that I got on `notebook.ipynb` and comment on it.


The purpose of this repository is just to compare, no political sides.
